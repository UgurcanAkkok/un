# UN (Ugur's Notes)

UN is an online, cli oriented note/task manager. The main idea is to create a task manager that is
easy to use for a cli-nerd like me, and the data should be accessible from anywhere.

- It should be easy to use
- The data should be available online but for those that only use single computer, it should support local backend
- We don't need TUI, also TUI's are incompatible with how unix cli usually works.
- Fancy things are good!
- The user should be able to take advantage of their usual workflow, like neovim, grep etc.
